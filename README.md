#DefyHateNow: Mobilising Civic Action Against Hate Speech and Directed Social Media Incitement to Violence in South Sudan.  #defyhatenow is an urgent community peacebuilding, training and conflict reconciliation project aiming to strengthen the voices and support the actions of peace &amp; youth oriented civil society organizations in South Sudan.  #defyhatenow seeks to support those voices acting against the conflict to go ‘viral’ within and outside the country – bringing the South Sudanese diaspora into the online peacebuilding framework, bridging gaps of knowledge and awareness of social media mechanisms between those with access to technology and those without.
